        <h1>GMHC's HIV Services</h1>
        <p>People living with HIV/AIDS who are on effective antiretroviral regimens can reduce their viral loads to “undetectable” levels and lower their changes of transmitting the virus to almost 0%. Thus, with suppressed communicability and the consequent cessation of new HIV infections, the end of the AIDS epidemic is now within reach. However, only 28% of the 1.1 million Americans currently living with HIV have reached this level of health. The remaining 792,000 people living with HIV will continue to threaten efforts to curb the epidemic, without measures to engage them in medical care.</p>

        <p>There are a multitude of reasons why 72% of people living with HIV/AIDS fail to achieve an undetectable viral load. Some do not know they are HIV positive, because they have not been tested. Others know they are positive, but have not accessed medical care out of fear, lack of insurance, or personal instability (e.g. homelessness, mental health issues). To address these barriers, GMHC offers holistic services designed to help people living with HIV to overcome the full range of obstacles to accessing medical care and adhering to HIV treatments. Your donation will support programs such as HIV testing and counseling, case management and housing assistance, mental health services, legal assistance, benefits advocacy, food and nutrition services, and job training and placement.</p>

          <h2>HIV Testing</h2>
          <p>GMHC’s David Geffen Center for HIV Prevention and Health Education (Testing Center) is the cornerstone of GMHC’s prevention programming. Clients of the Testing Center received counseling, testing, and prevention education. In the past year, GMHC conducted 3,172 HIV tests, of which 62 tests yielded a new HIV positive diagnosis.</p>

          <h2>Meals and Food Pantry</h2>
          <p>This program mitigates hunger by directly providing nutritious meals, maximizes the benefits of HIV/AIDS medications by helping clients adhere to their treatment regimens through proper nutrition; and breaks the isolation of people living with HIV/AIDS by providing congregate meals where socializing  and  mutual support is enculturated. Last year, GMHC served 72,361 hot meals and distributed 3,656 pantry bags of self-selected healthy foods.</p>

          <h2>Legal Services</h2>
          <p>Last year, the Legal Department assisted 1,083 clients, with 3,591 unique legal services. The Department provides representation and assistance to people living with HIV/AIDS with a focus on immigration (including family-based petitions, asylum applications, citizenship applications, and Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) applications); landlord-tenant issues; bankruptcy, consumer credit and tax issues; family law issues; advance directives; and HIV-related employment and public accommodation discrimination claims.  </p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>Housing Assistance</h2>
          <p>Approximately 77% of GMHC’s clients live below the poverty line, and 15% of our new clients are homeless or unstably housed. To help mitigate this problem, GMHC provided housing-support programs to close to 500 clients by assisting with paying rent, mortgage, and utilities. Additionally, GMHC provides housing advocacy services to clients threatened by eviction due to poverty and/or discrimination. For 450 clients, GMHC acts similarly to a guardian with assistance in paying their rent and utilities in a timely fashion each month to ensure that our clients maintain financial and housing stability. </p>

          <h2>Workforce Development</h2>
          <p>GMHC offers adult education and employment assistance to individuals interested in returning to work following an HIV positive diagnosis. By empowering individuals to become economically self-sufficient, GMHC also helps them take control over their health. Since the beginning of 2013, GMHC has provided vocational counseling and job training to 125 participants, of whom 58 have begun sustainable employment at companies such as Whole Foods, Duane Reade, and TJMaxx.</p>

          <h2>Benefits Advocacy</h2>
          <p>The Benefits Advocacy Unit worked with 410 clients to help them enroll in or troubleshoot issues with benefits such as Social Security, food stamps, and health insurance such as Medicare, ADAP, Medicaid, and private insurance. Additionally, the Benefits Advocacy staff is Certified Navigators for the New York State Health Benefit Exchange, under the Affordable Care Act. Navigators can assist clients and other individuals with choosing and enrolling in policies if they are uninsured or their current policies are slated to change under the ACA. </p>
